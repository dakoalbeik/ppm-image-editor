# ppm-image-editor

## Introduction

This web application enables the user to load PPM P3 files and render the pixels onto an HTML canvas. The app is able to rotate/flip the image by manipulating the position of the pixels. The user is able to download the newly edited PPM file locally. 

## Get started

Start by launching the `index.html` file in a web browser. There are test images provided in the test directory, but you are encouraged to use your own PPM image files.
